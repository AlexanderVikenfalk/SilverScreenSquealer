#### About this project: 
This project was made as the final project for a course with focus on integrating the use of web APIs into your own design. 
I decided to create a website that recommended a movie based on user input.

#### API's used:

* [Taste Kid](https://www.tastekid.com/read/api) for movie recommendations. 

* [The Movie Database](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started) for retrieving movie info and corresponding poster. 

#### Technologies used: 
* **HTML-5** structure and content.
* **CSS** for layout and desiggn.
* **Bootstrap** for responsive design.
* **Jquery** for effects and functionality.

#### Other notes: #### 
I had to rebuild big parts of the code twice(!). First because the AJAX-calls didn't react properly when nested. Second time it was because I realized that the assigment demanded a menu and since I hadn't started with "mobile first" it was really tricky to implement it. I've probably put around 70 + hours on this assigment and mainly spent that time rewriting my own code because I tried to cut corners in the beginning and didn't structure my code properly. The site is now "mobile first" and should diplay properly on ****phone**** and ****desktop**** with **** Edge **** or ****Chrome**** - lesson learned.
